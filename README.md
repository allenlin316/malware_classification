# Machine Learning-based Malware Classification


* This repository implement the malware detection method based on the paper  
[Mingdong Tang, and Quan Qian, "Dynamic API call sequence visualization for malware classification,"IET Information Security 13.4 (2019): 367 377.](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1049/iet-ifs.2018.5268)

## Dataset preprocessing
1. 3 classes(1clickdownload, 4shared, acda) from [Virusshare website](https://virusshare.com/)
2. Utilize `dynamic method` to transform malware into `json` by `CUCKOO Sandbox`
3. Utilize paper's method to transform `json` into images

> `malware_images` folder is for training  
> `Testing_images` folder is for testing

## Model
* Custom CNN model
* batch_size=4, epoch=1000, learning_rate=0.001
* Accuracy:  80%
